# Marketing - DRAFT

The [GraphQL Foundation](https://graphq.org/foundation) Marketing Committee, reconstituted in January 2023, plays a crucial role in orchestrating and executing marketing initiatives in support of the Foundation and its various projects. As part of the GraphQL Foundation Board's efforts, the Marketing Subcommittee collaborates with several other subcommittees, all dedicated to working on new and exciting projects planned for this year. Announcements about these programs and projects will be released throughout 2023.

This repository serves as a centralized platform for the marketing committee's efforts, including:

### Marketing Planning

The [plans](https://github.com/graphql/marketing/tree/main/plans) directory contains documents and resources related to the overall marketing strategy and objectives for GraphQLConf. This includes target audiences, messaging, and channels.

### Artifacts

The [assets](https://github.com/graphql/marketing/tree/main/assets) directory contains marketing artifacts, such as graphics, banners, social media images, and other promotional materials that can be used across various platforms and channels.

### Issues

The [issues](https://github.com/graphql/marketing/issues) section of the repository is used for tracking tasks, requests, and discussions related to marketing activities. Committee members can create new issues, assign them to collaborators, and track their progress.

### Discussions

The [discussions](https://github.com/graphql/marketing/discussions) section serves as a platform for open conversations, brainstorming sessions, and knowledge sharing among marketing committee members and other stakeholders. Topics can range from campaign ideas to feedback on promotional materials.
