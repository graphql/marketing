# Marketing - DRAFT

The [GraphQL Foundation](https://graphq.org/foundation) Marketing Committee, reconstituted in January 2023, plays a crucial role in orchestrating and executing marketing initiatives in support of the Foundation and its various projects. As part of the GraphQL Foundation Board's efforts, the Marketing Committee collaborates with several other committees, all dedicated to working on new and exciting projects planned for this year. Announcements about these programs and projects will be released throughout 2023.

This repository serves as a centralized platform for the marketing committee's efforts, including:

### Marketing Planning
